#I want to aim to undertsand how remote work has impacted employees especially after COVID-19. More and more companies are becoming remote so I want to show how these changes to beoming remote impact employees in a good way or bad way. 

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 1. How has remote work affected employees personal life? 
# 2. What are some of the benefits of remote work? As well as the negativies?
# 3. How has remote work affected employee productivity?
# 4. How has remote work improved or worsened employee mental health? 

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 1. Remote work has affected employees personal lives in a postitive way becuase it allows them to spend more time at homw with their families.

# 3. Remote work affects the productivity of employees becuase it allows them to work in a comfortable environment and at their own pace. 
# 4. Remote work has improved employees mental health becuase it has allowed them to be comfortable when working. 

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
 # Remote work prodcutivity dataset, remote work mental health dataset, api employee engagment 
# kaggle kernels pull alaaabdelstar/remote-work-productivity
# kaggle kernels pull alaaabdelstar/remote-work-productivity-mental-health
# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# I want to use the databasees to show how productivity has increased over the years due to remote work especially after COVID-19. I also want to show stats about how mental health has increased or decreased becuase of remote work 
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# using the data, i can then make a conlcusions about how remote work has improved or worsened over the years and how it has affected employees work and personal life. 
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# I want to merge the two datasets of productivity and mental health by using the well being score and the stree level to find out the different levels of stress.
